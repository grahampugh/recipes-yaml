# Jamf Script Recipes

These recipes upload a script to Jamf Pro and create a policy to deploy the script. Specifically, there are no packages in these recipes. The scripts used in these recipes are found in the `_Scripts` folder of this repo.

They are meant to provide examples on how to build a `script.jamf` recipe.
