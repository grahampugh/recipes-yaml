# Jamf Profile Recipes

These recipes create a configuration profile in Jamf Pro. The mobileconfig files or profile payload plist files used in these recipes are found in the `_Mobileconfigs` and `_Profile_Payloads` folders of this repo.

They are meant to provide examples on how to build a `profile.jamf` recipe.
