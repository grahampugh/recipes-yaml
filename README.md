# grahampugh-recipes in yaml format

## These are the yaml versions of Jamf recipes from autopkg/grahampugh-recipes

All Jamf recipes at [autopkg/grahampugh-recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/grahampugh-recipes) are currently in Plist format to allow AutoPkgr to see them.

These are the YAML versions of those recipes. They are intended only as a documentation resource. I do not recommend that you add this repo to your AutoPkg search directories, because it may interfere with JamfUploader.
