# grahampugh-recipes in yaml format

A few recipes not found elsewhere. To use them, enter the following command:

    autopkg repo-add grahampugh/recipes-yaml

Note that some recipes in this repo are designed to help package up software that is not publicly available. As such, those recipes have no `.download` recipe. Those recipes have their own `README` files to give further instruction.

## Wait, these are all yaml files!

I write my recipes as `yaml` files, and then convert them to `plist` format when I'm done. I find constructing the recipes much nicer in `yaml` format, and it ensures a consistent `plist` structure (e.g. alphabetised input keys).

If, on the other hand, you are interested in this technique, take a look at https://github.com/grahampugh/plist-yaml-plist

The recipes in plist format are available at autopkg/grahampugh-recipes
