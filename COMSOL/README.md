# COMSOL Multiphysics

There is no download recipe since COMSOL is not publicly available. Therefore you must specify a path to the package which must be obtained manually.

Run as:

    autopkg run --pkg /path/to/downloaded-comsol.dmg COMSOLMultiphysics.pkg

You must also override the keys `COMSOL_LICENSE_SERVER`, `COMSOL_LICENSE_NAME`, `COMSOL_LICENSE_COMPANY` and `COMSOL_LICENSE_TYPE`.  
These values are part of your licensing setup.
