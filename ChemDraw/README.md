# ChemDraw

There is no download recipe since ChemDraw is not publicly available. Therefore you must specify a path to the package which must be obtained manually.

Run as:

    autopkg run --pkg /path/to/downloaded-chemdraw.dmg ChemDraw.pkg

This recipe is designed to work with ChemDraw 18+. Previous versions were named "ChemDraw Professional"
