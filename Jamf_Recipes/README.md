# Jamf Recipes

These recipes are functionally equivalent to the "standard" JSS recipes available in the `autopkg/jss-recipes` repository.

They are meant to provide examples on how to build a `.jamf` recipe.

These recipes use the `JamfPolicyTemplate.xml` and `JamfSmartGroupTemplate.xml` files which are in the same folder.

PLIST versions of each recipe are provided in the `_PLIST_Versions` folder as examples.

**Note:** I don't use these recipes, so I'm not going to continually add to them.

If you wish to see more examples of recipes in here that were in the `jss-recipes` repo as `.jss` recipes, open a GitHub Issue to request the specific recipe you want. Asking for "all of them" will be ignored and the issue closed!
