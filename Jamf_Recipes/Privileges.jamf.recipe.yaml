    Privileges.app for macOS is designed to allow users to work as a standard user for day-to-day use, by providing a quick and easy way to get administrator rights when needed. When you do need admin rights, you can get them by clicking on the Privileges icon in your Dock.

    We believe all users, including all developers, can benefit from using Privileges.app. Working as a standard user instead of an administrator adds another layer of security to your Mac and is considered a security best practice. Privileges.app helps enable users to act as administrators of the system only when required.
